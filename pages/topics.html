                                    Each week for the first 4 weeks we had different topics within human computer interactions. 
                                    We began with Wearables and in the following week we dove into Playful interactions. Then after that we came across Artificial Creatures and lastly VR/AR. 
                                    In the following pages I will explain what those topics entails. 
                                    The assignment is to do more research about certain subject within each topic.

                            Wearables are objects that you can wear obviously. What we mean with wearables is wearable electronics. 
                            A smartwatch is an common examples of wearables.
                            But what about wearables in the future? Ever heard of smart tattoos? A smart tattoo is basically small fabric on your skin that can be used as
                            a input or output source. 
                            DuoSkin is a great example of a smart tattoo that is developed by Microsoft Research.

                    <p class="personal-intro topic solo-paragraph">
                        DuoSkin developed a new way to interact with user interfaces through skin. 
                        They use small pieces of fabrics that is made of gold paper which is skin-friendly and durable.
                        These fabrics can be applied on your skin.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        You can interacte with it by either touching or swiping just like you would on a mobile device. 
                        For each type of input such as button, slider or a 2d slider there is a different type of touch sensors design pattern that has to be applied for the user experience.
                        You can also use it for displaying your temperature levels which is shown with a ink layer that turns into another color based on your body temperature.
                        Lasty you can it for wireless communication. The DuoSkin uses NFC to achieve this, the NFC chip is connected to a coil to form a tag that can be scanned.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        To use the DuoSkin is very simple process (image on the left). You have to sketch the circuitry with a design tool. 
                        Then you have to create the circuitry on a tattoo paper and cut it out.
                        After that apply the gold layer. The following step is to mount the electronics onto the tattoo. 
                        The DuoSkin is ready to be put on a user skin just like a regular water tatoo.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The design of DuoSkin is small and thin, the gold paper that is used for the circuitry is also a trendy color for fashion which attracts attention.

                            Playful Interactions is a way to interact with an user by using gamification.
                            The purpose can be serious but it can also be for fun. The interface that we are discussing in this particular topic will be using unconventional input and output devices.
                            Playful interaction can also stimulate good behavior such as social interaction or make an user do something that he normal wouldn't do.

                    <p class="personal-intro topic">
                        Tic-tac-jump is a interactive game that students can go against eachother. This will be effective to boost up the mood of the students. 
                        We can use a projector to display the board on the ground and students have to jump to mark their spot on the board. 
                        This is competative multiplayer game in a interdependent exertion setup with shared space which is the board.
                    </p>
                    <h1 class="multiple-heading">Speed Camera Lottery</h1>
                    <p class="personal-intro topic">
                        The speed camera lottery is an playful interaction where drivers get a chance to win prize money.
                        A photo and the current speed will be recorded and shown on a board. 
                        Drivers that are over the speed limit will get a fine that later will be used as prize money.
                        Every obeying driver will a have chance to win the prize pool money. 
                        The purpose of this game is for drivers to drive responsible and to obey the traffic laws.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Speed camera's on top of traffic posts for taking pictures and tachometer for measuring car speed are used as input devices.
                        The output will be the speed limit sign on the road which indicating your current speed.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        It's a multiplayer game where you compete against other drivers in a lottery game which is based on luck.
                        You know what other drivers are currently doing which can lead to adjusting your current speed to the right one.
                        It kinda falls under knowing and comparing in a parallel exertion.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        This topic is fun and interesting because you have to think outside the box to come up with an interaction that is fun and at same time meets your goal. 
                        Playful interaction is very good method for call to action and I think it's going to be must to include in your projects.
                        The use of unconventional input and output devices in playful way always amazes me.

                            Artificial Creatures are mainly developed robotics that can show or recognize emotional/human and animal behaviour. We want to perceive robotics as living beings.
                            During the lecture they showed us a lot of examples such as dog companion for elderly people, artificial creature that opens door based on a specific input.
                            These creatures act differently based on the input they are sensing such as scanning the environment or looking for a specific need.

                    <p class="personal-intro topic">
                        Homeostatias model was explained in the lecture. Homeostatias model simply explained is devices identifying needs.
                        These needs are important for the device in question to function properly atleast at a primary level. These devices have the tendency to keep the balance between all the needs.
                        Our assignment is to identify the needs to certain given devices and define how these devices feels when certain needs is met and vice versa. 
                        I chose the bycicle because is what we most use in the Netherlands.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The 3 most important needs that a bycicle need is air in the tires, chain cleanness, someone pedaling.
                        The amount the air in the tires is important when riding a bycicle.
                        The lower the air the more energy is needed to use the bycicle which makes him frustated because that not efficient at all.
                        If there is no air at all the bycicle is not usable. 
                        In this case is the bycicle frustated because it's not functional.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        If there is dirt in your chain then is your bike very frustasted.
                        Because you're not keeping it clean, aside from that the rotation of the chain wont rotate smooth when pedaling and at worst you can break the crankset which is the technically the brain of the bycicle.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        If there is enough air in the tire and the chain is clean but no one is pedaling then is the bycicle sad because the bycicle is functional but no one currently using it.
                        The bike is happy when an user is pedaling, air in the tire is enough and the chain is clean. The bycicle is fulfilling his job.

                            We as person want to perceive something new, something that you can never imagine. AR & VR makes that possible.
                            Augmented Reality (AR) is a computer generated layer on top our own vision which only viewed through a device. This makes it possible to create unique interactions.
                            Virtual Reality (VR) is a computer generated world that you can experience by wielding a big ass goggles.
                            AR & VR are both used for entertainment and serious cases such as medical care and military.

                            Our assignment for AR & VR is divided in 3 parts. The first part is to think of a concept for 3 different area of expertise and describe these. I chose museums, sports and healthcare. The second part is to find fun, interesting or impressive projects and describe it.
                            During the workshop we practiced with Unreal Engine and created a virtual world which contained interactivity. Our last task to describe what an user can experience in our world.

                        With AR Technologies in the museums you can easily get rid of all the long information boards and use AR instead to show additional information. 
                        Look at the example above, you can hover your tablet over of a photo to get more information about it. To make more interactive you can add videos and games.
                        It's also possible to add tour guide into the system and perhabs location of restaurants and bathrooms.

                            I like the idea of showing information about a ongoing match.
                            Imagine you are watching a baseball match and you want to know more about the match. 
                            You can easily take out your phone or tablet, scan the field and get all information you need with one click. 
                            That could be stats of the players that are currently playing, match history, betting odds, stadium information or even interact with other viewers.
                            How awesome is that?

                            It's sometimes hard for doctors to explain a concept to another doctor.
                            Using AR you can setup your plan and show it to them or even collabrate with eachother.
                            Information can easily be interpret in a wrong way, having a visualization helps a lot.
                            This can bring down the error percentage in healtcare and provide a easier way to communicate with your colleagues and patient.
                            You can use AR to show a patient what their condition is and how you are going to approach it.

                                In this VR you can practice your photography skills. You can mess with different camera setting and move around in the room to get best photo. 
                                You can practice at home without being at a physical location. This vr game is developed by Robomodo. What really challenging for them was to turning a 3d world into a 2d image. 
                                I find this VR game cool because I did a minor in photography and I know that is not easy to take photos. This game can up your photography game.
