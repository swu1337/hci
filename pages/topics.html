                                    Each week for the first 4 weeks we had different topics within human computer interactions. 
                                    We began with Wearables and in the following week we dove into Playful interactions. Then after that we came across Artificial Creatures and lastly VR/AR. 
                                    In the following pages I will explain what those topics imply. 
                                    The assignment is to do more research about certain subject within each topic.

                            Wearables are objects that you can wear obviously. What we mean with wearables is wearable electronics. 
                            A smartwatch is an common examples of wearables.
                            But what about wearables in the future? Ever heard of smart tattoos? A smart tattoo is basically small fabric on your skin that can be used as
                            a input or output source. 
                            DuoSkin is a great example of a smart tattoo that is development right now.

                    <h1>DuoSkin</h1>
                    <p class="personal-intro">
                        DuoSkin developed a new way to interact with user interfaces through skin. 
                        They use small pieces of fabrics that is made of gold paper which is skin-friendly and it's durable.
                        These fabrics will be applied on your skin which can be seen as tattoos.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        You can interacte with it by either touching or swiping just like you would on a mobile device. 
                        For each type of input such as button, slider or a 2d slider there is a different type of touch sensors design pattern that has to be applied of the user experience.
                        You can also use it for displaying your temperature levels which is shown with a ink layer that turns into another color measuring your body temperature.
                        Lasty you can it for wireless communication. The DuoSkin uses NFC to achieve this, the NFC chip is connected to a coil to form a tag can be scanned. You can use for payments for example.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        To use the DuoSkin is very simple process (image on the left). You have to sketch the circuitry with a design tool. 
                        Then you have to create the circuitry on a tattoo paper and cut it out.
                        After that apply the gold layer. The following step is to mount the electronics onto the tattoo. 
                        The DuoSkin is ready to be put on a user skin just like a regular water tatoo.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The design of DuoSkin is small and thin, the gold paper that is used for the circuitry is also a trendy color for fashion which attracts a lot of attention.
