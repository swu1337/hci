                    <h1>Assignment</h1>
                    <p class="personal-intro">
                        Arduino is small device that is built for developers to learn the basic of combining circuitry and programming. 
                        We are running sketches (code) on the Arduino application from our laptops to talk to the Arduino device. 
                        There are different input and output devices to play with such as LED, buttons, servomotor, speakers etc. 
                        Our assignment is to explain what is happening and show the outcome with the corresponding code. 
                        For a nerd like me, I never worked with Arduino before but I am excited to learn.
                        I took a little sneak peak at code and it looks like Javascript so it should be easy to work it.

                            In the loop() We used a for loop ironic right? to loop through and increasing the brightness which was defined at 0 which is off and to 255 which is the max brightness for a LED. This creates the fade in effect.
                            We counter the other LED by subtracting the 255 which is max with the current brightness which is increasing time by time and that will result in decrements thus fading out.

                            Below you can find the code that was used to achieve this. Basically is the same code from exercise 4c but we have a new input, potentiometer.
                            When you turn the knob we can read the value from it but the value is different from what we need. That's why we used map() to get the right range of values that we can use for the LEDs.

                        <p class="personal-intro topic">
                            The exercise here is about to get real, you might want to sit down for this. In this excercise we will explain the voltage divider formula.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            The voltage divider formula is: Vo = Vi * R2 / R1 + R2. 
                            Vo stands for voltage output what was the real voltage that is going into a LED, Vi stands for voltage input which is coming from the arduino board which is 5V and R stand for resistance of resistor. 
                            R can be static (220ohm resistor) but also dynamic (a LDR). We are using 2 LDR's in this exercise.

                            <br />
                            If both LDR’s have the same light source than the voltage output will always be the half since Vo = Vi * R2 / R1 + R2 and R1 = R2 and vice versa. It will be then R/2R which is same as 1/2.
                            <br />
                            <br /> 
                            If R2 is in the dark and R1 in light than the Vo is going to be close the Vi. R2 has a higher ohm value and R1 little to none then you’re almost dividing R2 with R2.
                            Vo = Vi * 5000000 / (5000000 + low value from light).
                            <br />
                            <br /> 
                            If R1 is in the dark and R2 in light than the Vo will be small. R2 has a lower value and R1 higher value which you are dividing a small value with a large number resulting a in number almost to zero.
                            Vo = Vi * low value from light / (5000000 + low value).
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            In the video you can see the value change when I turn on the lights on.
                            Its hard to get a very low value since there is still light coming from my window so you wont notice a big difference. But there is a value change;

                        The exercise here is to experiment with a new output device which is the servomotor. servomotors are motors that turn to a precise position like a steering wheel. 
                        We want them to use in a interesting way.

                        It uses a position to pin point the rotation position in the servomotor. 
                        With a loop we are changing that position each time. 
                        When the max rotation is reach we reset it back to the beginning. So is the rythm created.

                    <h1>Assignment</h1>
                    <p class="personal-intro">
                        This assignment consists of 2 parts. 
                        The first part is to use a projector to project different sources like picture and videos on an objects like walls, pyramide, mannequin and etc. 
                        We called this SAR (Spatial Augmented Reality).
                        We used a program called MadMapper to map out the object and project something awesome on it. 
                        This program allow us to play with perspective and create 3d looking projection. 
                        Our assignment to use our imagination and make something great.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The second part is to make an VR environment in Unreal Engine. 
                        Unreal Engine is an engine design to make 3d models and environment especially for games. 
                        Our assignment for this part was to create a banana catching game where you can move around.

                        Spatial Augmented Reality is a way to project different sources such as pictures and videos on different objects.
                        We followed the tutorial that was given for the installions. That was basically to download MadMapper and setup the projector.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        We started to expirement with text on a plain canvas. We kinda created a merchandise for our friend Geert here. 
                        After that we moved into pictures and videos. For the pictures we tried to map a bodybuilder on someone body.
                        Then we tried to map a world on a someone hand trying to create a 3d object. 
                        We also tried that with a mushroom but it didn't work out was we planned. 
                        I think we need to work on mapping the round edges.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        After a lot of experimenting we got hang out it and started to try to out perspective angles. We build a pyramide and taped on a board with the point facing the projector. 
                        We mapped out each side on the pyramide and project different video's. 
                        We also tried to other input like facecam. 
                        We got the facecam working and project the livecam on a mannequin head which was very creepy.
                        Pictures and video's are on the following page.

                        Unreal engine is an engine where you can build environment and games. 
                        Unreal engine is developed by Epic Games. 
                        There is a lot of games made with Unreal Engine. Fortnite a popular game that is build with Unreal Engine.
                        Our assignment was to follow the given tutorials and make a banana catching game which has it own environment.
                        The goal is to get an idea how the software works and how we can implement for our own use.

                    <h2>Computer Vision</h2>
                    <h1>Assignment</h1>
                    <p class="personal-intro">
                        This assignment is also divided into 2 parts.
                        In the first assignment we are going to learn how to use Processing. 
                        Processing is an open source programming language and environment for people who want to build interactive systems.
                        It's also the perfect tool for learning the fundamentals of programming.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The second assignment is about Computer Vision. Computer vision is a field of computer science that works on enabling computers to see,
                        identify and process images in the same way that human vision does, and then provide
                        appropriate output. We can combine this with Processing. An example is using camera.

                            The assignment was to follow the a given tutorial. 
                            Some of the exercises were there to explain and show how the code works. 
                            In a simply way you can use the function draw() to draw something on a canvas. 
                            Processing is pretty easy to understand. They have build in functions to draw like rectangle, circle, triangle and much more. 
                            You can change the color of each individual object, animate object to move to certain point on the canvas or let it react to the mouse. 
                            It is also possible to connect Arduino to processing. For example getting data from a input device that is connected to the arduino board.

                            The exercise here is to play with ellipses. Our assignment was to copy a given image on the top left. 
                            Its basically 3 ellipses with different shapes, colors and location.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Below you can find the code that was used to achieve this. 
                            Basically we used the ellipse() function to create different shapes of ellipse. 
                            In the parameter, you can give the x- and y-location of they location and then the width and height. 
                            You have to use fill() to fill the ellipse. The hardest part is to find the right locations for the ellipses.
                            My result is on the bottom left, too me their almost the same its the idea that counts.

                        The exercise here is to play with other shapes than ellipses. Our assignment was to draw 4 different shapes.

                        Below you can find the code that was used to achieve this. 
                        Processing has built in shapes like line(), triangle(), quad(), rect() and that's why it's easy to program in processing.
                        I experimented with these functions to create different shapes. It's 
                        basically give the functions the necessary arguments.

                        Below you can find the code that was used to achieve this.
                        First we get the x and y from the mouse location and diameter and set it as color value.
                        Secondly we increase the diameter every time the draw() function is called and use the mouse x and y as the location for the ellipse. 
                        We don't want to diameter to be bigger than the screen so we reset when it's over 100

                            We had to download a library that allows us to use to use video and camera. For tracking our face we had to download OpenCV library. Other libraries were to track to brightness source in the room and to track to multiple colors.
                            Each of these library has code examples so it was easy to use to follow.

                                The exercise here is to experiment with facial recognition.
                                The library OpenCV en Video were used to able to get a circle around someone's face. Our assignment to hide our eyes with a black rectangle making me anonymous.

                                <br />
                                Below you can find the code that was used to achieve this.
                                Most of the code were from a example.
                                We added a extra line for the black rectangle and you guess it using the rect() function and move it down to match the eyes.

                                2 different libraries were given to us. Our assignment was to use one of these libraries to make something cool.
                                I experimented with the brightness one. The library circles the brightest source.
                                <br />

                                What I changed was to color the whole background based on the brightest location. So the location x and y wil be used as red and green in rgb color value.
