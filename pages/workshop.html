                                    In week 2 through 5, we are getting additional workshop about basic Arduino, VR and Computer vision. Each week has it's own assignment. 
                                    These workshop cover the practical and technical tools and techniques needed for the upcoming lab weeks. These workshop to get your hand on the technology behind all the discussed topics.

                    <h1>Assignment</h1>
                    <p class="personal-intro">
                        Arduino is small device that is built for developers to learn the basic of combining circuitry and programming. 
                        We are running sketches (code) on the Arduino application from our laptops to talk to the Arduino device. 
                        There are different input and output devices to play with such as LED, buttons, servomotor, speakers etc. 
                        Our assignment is to explain what is happening and show the outcome with the corresponding code. 
                        For a nerd like me, I never worked with Arduino before but I am excited to learn.
                        I took a little sneak peak at code and it looks like Javascript so it should be easy to work it.

                            In the loop() We used a for loop ironic right? to loop through and increasing the brightness which was defined at 0 which is off and to 255 which is the max brightness for a LED. This creates the fade in effect.
                            We counter the other LED by subtracting the 255 which is max with the current brightness which is increasing time by time and that will result in decrements thus fading out.

                            Below you can find the code that was used to achieve this. Basically is the same code from exercise 4c but we have a new input, potentiometer.
                            When you turn the knob we can read the value from it but the value is different from what we need. That's why we used map() to get the right range of values that we can use for the LEDs.

                        <p class="personal-intro topic">
                            The exercise here is about to get real, you might want to sit down for this. In this excercise we will explain the voltage divider formula.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            The voltage divider formula is: Vo = Vi * R2 / R1 + R2. 
                            Vo stands for voltage output what was the real voltage that is going into a LED, Vi stands for voltage input which is coming from the arduino board which is 5V and R stand for resistance of resistor. 
                            R can be static (220ohm resistor) but also dynamic (a LDR). We are using 2 LDR's in this exercise.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            If both LDR’s have the same light source than the voltage output will always be the half since Vo = Vi * R2 / R1 + R2 and R1 = R2 and vice versa. It will be then R/2R which is same as 1/2.
                            <br />
                            <br /> 
                            If R2 is in the dark and R1 in light than the Vo is going to be close the Vi. R2 has a higher ohm value and R1 little to none then you’re almost dividing R2 with R2.
                            Vo = Vi * 5000000 / (5000000 + low value from light).
                            <br />
                            <br /> 
                            If R1 is in the dark and R2 in light than the Vo will be small. R2 has a lower value and R1 higher value which you are dividing a small value with a large number resulting a in number almost to zero.
                            Vo = Vi * low value from light / (5000000 + low value).
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            In the video you can see the value change when I turn on the lights on.
                            Its hard to get a very low value since there is still light coming from my window so you wont notice a big difference. But there is a value change;

                            As you can see when you cover the LDR, the LEDs will dim.

                        The exercise here is to experiment with a new output device which is the servomotor. servomotors are motors that turn to a precise position like a steering wheel.

                        With a loop we are changing that position each time. 
                        When the max rotation is reach we reset it back to the beginning. So is the rythm created.

                    <p class="personal-intro">
                        This assignment consists of 2 parts. 
                        The first part is to use a projector to project different sources like picture and videos on an objects like walls, pyramide, mannequin and etc. 
                        We called this SAR (Spatial Augmented Reality).
                        We used a program called MadMapper to map out the object and project something awesome on it. 
                        This program allow us to play with perspective and create 3d looking projection. 
                        Our assignment to use our imagination and make something great.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The second part is to make an VR environment in Unreal Engine. 
                        Unreal Engine is a engine design to make 3d models and environment. 
                        Our assignment for this part was to create a banana catching game where you can move around.

                            Spatial Augmented Reality is a way to project different sources such as pictures and videos on different objects.
                            We followed the tutorial that was given for the installions. That was basically to download MadMapper and setup the projector.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            We started to expirement with text on a plain canvas. We kinda created a merchandise for our friend Geert here. 
                            After that we moved into pictures and videos. For the pictures we tried to map a bodybuilder on someone body.
                            Then we tried to map a world on a someone hand trying to create a 3d object. 
                            We also tried that with a mushroom but it didn't work out was we planned. 
                            I think we need to work on mapping the round edges.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            After a lot of experimenting we got hang out it and started to try to out perspective angles. We build a pyramide and taped on a board with the point facing the projector. 
                            We mapped out each side on the pyramide and project different video's. 
                            We also tried to other input like facecam. 
                            We got the facecam working and project the livecam on a mannequin head which was very creepy.
                            <br />
                            <br />
