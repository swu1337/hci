                                <h1>Playful Interactions</h1>
                                <p class="personal-intro">
                                    Lab weeks consist of 2 weeks of intense work. It was located at a old factory Maakhaven. First we were divided in groups in each topic. 
                                    My first choice was playful interaction and luckily I got it too. 
                                    In these two weeks we have to build a prototype and showcase it in the exposition that is held at the end of the lab weeks. 
                                    During these weeks we will be brainstorming, concepting, designing, building, coding and test various prototypes.
                                    The prototype needs to have a connection within the chosen topic. For me that was playful interaction, our prototype has to be playful and interactive during the exposition. 
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    Below you can find a recap of each day of the lab weeks and the end product we made with a brief reflection.

                        We were grouped by the teachers and our portfolio which is what you are looking at right now had also an influence on the group making decision.

                    <p class="personal-intro">
                        We started with only a table and chairs.
                        First thing we did was to get to know eachother better. 
                        Everyone had to tell something about themself and why they chose CMD or UX as a study. 
                        Furthermore everyone mentioned what their field of expertise were so that we can divide the work efficiently. 
                        For me that was coding and building.
                        We also discussed why we chose the topic playful interaction.
                        After that we started to brainstorm ideas for our concept. 
                        We used the examples that we discussed in our lectures as an inspiration.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        For most of teammates including me found that changing behaviour a important factor was during the brainstorm session.
                        So we decided to brainstorm on different types of bad behaviour that we want to change. 
                        Our most common bad behaviour were throwing stuff and food away and to have a lot of stress.
                        We tought of 2 good concepts which were screaming booth where you can release stress by screaming and throwing stuff in the bin for recycling.

                    <p class="personal-intro">
                        After the brainstorm session we tried different available technologies. 
                        We did this to get new ideas on our concept. 
                        We tried different technologies and sensors such as the leap motion, proximity sensor and the touch board from Bare Conductive.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I tried the leap motion and I dont think we can use it for our concept. But it was a cool technology though.
                        Most of the existing project for leap motion are build on a windows machine which we didn't at the time.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Later on me and Ondřej tried to get the touch board Bare Conductive working but we couldn't figure it out and that was our first day.

                    <p class="personal-intro">
                        Me and Sophia decided that we are going to try to get the touch board to work.
                        We followed the online instruction to the teeth but it wasn't working. We asked our teacher for help. 
                        Apparently the touch board that we got was modified into a midi board which is technically a controller for sounds.
                        We got it to work and it played a sound everytime we touch an input.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        We didn't get any photos or videos from the touch board because it wasn't working before. 
                        When we got it to work we got so excited that it worked that we forget to take photos.
                        By figuring the touch board we could of think endless possibilities of using this in our both of concepts.

                        After testing some of the technologies we decided to do another concepting.
                        We decided to add a extra feature that you can touch on the wall in the scream booth to hear relaxing sound. 
                        This idea came from touch board experiment.
                        We wanted to project sound waves in the booth that reacts to the sound coming from the microphone.
                        We also changed our recycling game to a touch board game where there is a huge wall where you have to touch in certain pattern that is shown on the board.
                        It's combination of whack-a-mole and memory. 
                        Due to experimenting with different technologies we added more features to our concept. 
                        Konstantin, Lotte and Ondrjev worked on the code for proximity with led strips which was also added to our concept: the screaming booth.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Later that day we got a presentation about thinkering as a job. 
                        He showed us his work and the process behind it. 
                        He started just like us, experimenting with techology and after he started making prototypes and publish them online. 
                        Company like Coca Cola, Efteling saw his work and hire him for a job.
                        It was very inspirational and I like how he made a living out of just thinkering with technologies.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I had to leave early for my dutch resit.
                        After I left, my group tried to project on a mannequin for our concept: the screaming booth.

                            Artificial Creatures are mainly developed robotics that can show or recognize emotional/human and animal behaviour. We want to perceive robotics as living beings.
                            During the lecture they showed us a lot of examples such as dog companion for elderly people, artificial creature that opens door based on a specific input.
                            These creatures act differently based on the input they are sensing such as scanning the environment or looking for a specific need.

                            Artificial Creatures are mainly developed robotics that can show or recognize emotional/human and animal behaviour. We want to perceive robotics as living beings.
                            During the lecture they showed us a lot of examples such as dog companion for elderly people, artificial creature that opens door based on a specific input.
                            These creatures act differently based on the input they are sensing such as scanning the environment or looking for a specific need.
