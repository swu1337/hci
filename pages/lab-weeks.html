                                <h1>Playful Interactions</h1>
                                <p class="personal-intro">
                                    Lab weeks consist of 2 weeks of intense work. It was located at a old factory Maakhaven. First we were divided in groups in each topic. 
                                    My first choice was playful interaction and luckily I got it too. 
                                    In these two weeks we have to build a prototype and showcase it in the exposition that is held at the end of the lab weeks. 
                                    During these weeks we will be brainstorming, concepting, designing, building, coding and test various prototypes.
                                    The prototype needs to have a connection within the chosen topic. For me that was playful interaction, our prototype has to be playful and interactive during the exposition. 
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    Below you can find a recap of each day of the lab weeks and the end product we made with a brief reflection.

                        We were grouped by the teachers and our portfolio which is what you are looking at right now had also an influence on the group making decision.

                    <p class="personal-intro">
                        We started with only a table and chairs.
                        First thing we did was to get to know eachother better. 
                        Everyone had to tell something about themself and why they chose CMD or UX as a study. 
                        Furthermore everyone mentioned what their field of expertise were so that we can divide the work efficiently. 
                        For me that was coding and building.
                        We also discussed why we chose the topic playful interaction.
                        After that we started to brainstorm ideas for our concept. 
                        We used the examples that we discussed in our lectures as an inspiration.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        For most of teammates including me found that changing behaviour a important factor was during the brainstorm session.
                        So we decided to brainstorm on different types of bad behaviour that we want to change. 
                        Our most common bad behaviour were throwing stuff and food away and to have a lot of stress.
                        We tought of 2 good concepts which were screaming booth where you can release stress by screaming and throwing stuff in the bin for recycling.

                    <p class="personal-intro">
                        After the brainstorm session we tried different available technologies. 
                        We did this to get new ideas on our concept. 
                        We tried different technologies and sensors such as the leap motion, proximity sensor and the touch board from Bare Conductive.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I tried the leap motion and I dont think we can use it for our concept. But it was a cool technology though.
                        Most of the existing project for leap motion are build on a windows machine which we didn't at the time.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Later on me and Ondřej tried to get the touch board Bare Conductive working but we couldn't figure it out and that was our first day.

                    <p class="personal-intro">
                        Me and Sophia decided that we are going to try to get the touch board to work.
                        We followed the online instruction to the teeth but it wasn't working. We asked our teacher for help. 
                        Apparently the touch board that we got was modified into a midi board which is technically a controller for sounds.
                        We got it to work and it played a sound everytime we touch an input.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        We didn't get any photos or videos from the touch board because it wasn't working before. 
                        When we got it to work we got so excited that it worked that we forget to take photos.
                        By figuring the touch board we could of think endless possibilities of using this in our both of concepts.

                    <p class="personal-intro topic">
                        After testing some of the technologies we decided to do another concepting.
                        We decided to add a extra feature that you can touch on the wall in the scream booth to hear relaxing sound. 
                        This idea came from touch board experiment.
                        We wanted to project sound waves in the booth that reacts to the sound coming from the microphone.
                        We also changed our recycling game to a touch board game where there is a huge wall where you have to touch in certain pattern that is shown on the board.
                        It's combination of whack-a-mole and memory. 
                        Due to experimenting with different technologies we added more features to our concept. 
                        Konstantin, Lotte and Ondrjev worked on the code for proximity with led strips which was also added to our concept: the screaming booth.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Later that day we got a presentation about thinkering as a job. 
                        He showed us his work and the process behind it. 
                        He started just like us, experimenting with techology and after he started making prototypes and publish them online. 
                        Company like Coca Cola, Efteling saw his work and hire him for a job.
                        It was very inspirational and I like how he made a living out of just thinkering with technologies.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I had to leave early for my dutch resit.
                        After I left, my group tried to project on a mannequin for our concept: the screaming booth.

                        After 2 days of concepting and trying stuff out we decided to focus on getting one concept that we want to work towards to.

                        We decide to go with the interactive wall game instead of the screaming booth because the wall was easier to execute in our opinion. 
                        Beside we think the touching wall is more interactive and fun for the people visiting.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Our concept is a interactive wall where you have to touch in a certain given sequence of color.
                        So you have a pattern of colors shown on the wall. 
                        You have as a player have to follow that pattern.
                        It gets harder and harder each time with more colors.
                        We want to make multiplayer too because the competitive aspect is what most people like.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        We heard from other groups that they want to use the touch board too.
                        Since we had it for 2 days straight, we had to give other groups the chance test it. 
                        We didn't want to buy one because it was very price around 120 euro with a starter kit. 
                        So we decided to contact a teacher and ask what we can do instead. He told us instead of touching we can use throwing. 
                        Since it's wall. He told us to make holes and use sensor to detect something going through.
                        We found that a better solution and it's also a lot cheaper so we went with it.
                        We started to make some sketches and trying proximity sensor for detecting objects going through.     
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Konstantin, Lotte and Sophia worked on the storyline for our concept. 
                        The story that we like the most was to use the holes as our mouths and that the player has to feed us by throwing food through the holes.

                        Me and Ondrjev researched the proximity sensor. 
                        We wanted to test the data that was coming through when a object is closer to the sensor.
                        I built the circuitry and Ondrjev worked on the code.
                        We wanted to get the data from Arduino to Processing since the game is going to be build in Processing. 
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        We tried one, it works, but the challenge was to get two works without interfering with each other.
                        I installed the second proximity sensor on the opposite side.
                        Our idea was if two works then adding more will be easy to do because we only have to update the array then.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        We also got a presentation about artificial intelligence with emotion. 
                        He showed us that an AI doesn't have to be in a form a human being to create emotion.
                        Too bad we can't use this information because we have different topic but it was informative.
                        I found the psychology behind AI interesting.
