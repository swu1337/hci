                                <h1>Playful Interactions</h1>
                                <p class="personal-intro">
                                    Lab weeks consist of 2 weeks of intense work. It was located at a old factory called Maakhaven. First we were divided in groups of each topic. 
                                    My first choice was playful interaction and luckily I got it too. 
                                    In these two weeks we have to build a prototype and showcase it in the exposition that is held at the end of the lab weeks. 
                                    During these weeks we will be brainstorming, concepting, designing, building, coding and test various prototypes.
                                    The prototype needs to have a connection within the chosen topic. For me that was playful interaction, our prototype has to be playful and interactive during the exposition.

                                    <br />

                        We were grouped by the teachers and our portfolio which is what you are looking at right now had also an influence on the group making decision.

                    <p class="personal-intro">
                        We started with only a table and chairs.
                        First thing we did was to get to know each other better. 
                        Everyone had to tell something about themself and why they chose CMD or UX as a study. 
                        Furthermore everyone mentioned what their field of expertise were so that we can divide the work efficiently. 
                        For me that was coding and building.
                        We also discussed why we chose the topic playful interaction.
                        After that we started to brainstorm ideas for our concept. 
                        We used the examples that we discussed in our lectures as an inspiration.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        For most of teammates including me found that changing behaviour a important factor was during the brainstorm session.
                        So we decided to brainstorm on different types of bad behaviour that we want to change. 
                        Our most common bad behaviour were throwing stuff and food away and to have a lot of stress.
                        We thought of 2 good concepts which were screaming booth where you can release stress by screaming into it and other concept was to throwing stuff in the corresponding bin.

                    <p class="personal-intro">
                        After the brainstorm session we decided to try different available technologies. 
                        By doing this we are getting new ideas for our concepts. 
                        We tried different technologies and sensors such as the leap motion, proximity sensor and the touch board from Bare Conductive.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I tried the leap motion and I dont think we can use it for our concept. But it was a cool technology though.
                        Most of the existing project for leap motion are build on a windows machine which we didn't have at the time.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Later on me and Ond≈ôej tried to get the touch board Bare Conductive to work but we couldn't figure it out.
                        It was at end of our day one.

                    <p class="personal-intro">
                        Me and Sophia decided that we are going to try to get the touch board to work.
                        We followed the online instruction to the teeth but it wasn't working. I even tried to redownload every files that were missing in the SD card.
                        We asked our teacher for help. 
                        Apparently the touch board that we got was modified into a midi board which is technically a controller for sounds.
                        I found another tutorial specifically for the midi board.
                        By following that specific tutorial we finally got it to work and it played a sound everytime we touch an input.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        We didn't get any photos or videos from the touch board because it wasn't working before. 
                        When we got it to work we got so excited that it worked that we forget to take photos.
                        By figuring the touch board we could of think endless possibilities that we can apply into our own concepts.

                    <p class="personal-intro topic">
                        After testing some of the technologies we decided to do another concepting.
                        We decided to add a extra feature that you can touch on the wall in the scream booth to hear relaxing sounds. 
                        This idea came from touch board experiment.
                        We wanted to project sound waves in the booth that reacts to the sound coming from the microphone.
                        We also changed our recycling game to a touch board game where there is a huge wall where you have to touch in certain pattern that is shown on the board.
                        It's combination of whack-a-mole and memory. 
                        Due to experimenting with different technologies we added more features to our concept. 
                        Konstantin, Lotte and Ond≈ôej worked on the code for proximity with LED strips which was also added to our concept: the screaming booth.
                        The LED strips is for when someone enters the booth, it wil turn on.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Later on that day we got a presentation about thinkering as a job. 
                        He showed us his work and the process behind it. 
                        He started just like us, experimenting with techology and after that he started making prototypes and publish them online. 
                        Company like Coca Cola, Efteling saw his work and hire him for a job.
                        It was very inspirational and I like how he made a living out of just thinkering with technologies.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I had to leave early for my dutch resit.
                        We got an idea from one of HCI assistant who had this course last year. He said that we could of do a join effort concept during the expo where visitors have to scream in the booth to keep the projected lungs working. 
                        After I left, my group tried to project the lungs on a mannequin for our concept: the screaming booth.

                    <h1 class="info-heading">Definitive concept</h1>
                    <p class="personal-intro topic">
                        After 2 days of concepting and trying stuff out we decided to focus on getting one concept that we want to work towards to. 
                        We had 2 concept in mind which were the screaming booth with LED strips and sound waves on the wall and the interactive whack-a-mole memory wall game.
                        We decide to go with the interactive wall game instead of the screaming booth because the wall was doable in 2 weeks. 
                        Beside that I think wall game is going to be more interactive and fun for the people visiting.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Our concept is a interactive wall where you have to touch in a certain given sequence of color.
                        So you have a pattern of colors shown on the wall. 
                        You have as a player have to follow that pattern.
                        It gets harder and harder each time with more colors.
                        We want to make multiplayer too because the competitive aspect makes it more interactive
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        We heard from other groups that they want to use the touch board too.
                        Since we had it for 2 days straight, we had to give other groups the chance test it. 
                        We didn't want to buy one because it was very price, it was around 120 euro as a starter kit. 
                        So we decided to contact a teacher and ask what we can do instead. Tim told us instead of touching we can use throwing. 
                        Since it's wall. He told us to make holes and use sensor to detect something going through.
                        We found that a better solution and it's also a lot cheaper so we went with it.
                        We started by making some sketches and after that me and Ond≈ôej tried the proximity sensor for detecting objects going through.     
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Konstantin, Lotte and Sophia worked on the storyline for our concept. 
                        The story that we like the most was to use the holes as our mouths and that the player has to feed us by throwing food through the holes. Which is technically throwing food in our mouths.

                    <p class="personal-intro">
                        Me and Ond≈ôej researched the proximity sensor. 
                        We wanted to test the data that was coming through when a object is closer to the sensor.
                        I built the circuitry and Ond≈ôej worked on the code.
                        We wanted to get the data from Arduino to Processing because the game is going to be build in Processing. 
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        We tried one, it works, but the challenge was to get two works without interfering with each other.
                        I installed the second proximity sensor on the opposite side.
                        Our idea was if two works then adding more will be easy to do because we only have to update the code.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        In the video you can see the value change to be lower when my hand is in front of the sensor. 
                        Ond≈ôej figure how to draw data on the screen. 
                        The left numbers are for the left sensor and right number are for the right sensor.

                        Our first task was to come up with promise that we are going work towards to. 
                        Our promise was "We promise you to train your aim".
                        Since it's you have to precise when throwing food at our mouths, you will train your aim in the process of playing the game.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I attached the proximity sensor on the back of the hole in our concept wall which was a cardboard box to test if we can detect an object going through.
                        Sadly was the ball to fast and sensor wont able to catch the ball going through. 
                        We came up with a solution to make a tunnel for the ball to through and detect there. 
                        In front of the tunnel we want to put a net to slow the down the ball. 
                        So me and Lotte went looking for a net.
                        After we came back me and Lotte built the tunnel and test it out. 
                        I attached the sensor on the tunnel and it's ready to test. Still with the net and tunnel the ball was too fast.

                    <p class="personal-intro topic">
                        We concluded that the proximity won't work for our concept.
                        The object is going to fast and the sensor won't able to detect it on time.
                        So we have to come with another solution for the detecting moving objects.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        We brainstormed together for a solution and we even ask for help from other groups and teachers.
                        During our brainstorm session we realised that a tunnel is not a solution at all since people will be throwing food and that we can have shapes that won't roll at all. 
                        We also thought of using IR(infra red) sensor that can detect fast moving object but it won't still work because the detection area is so narrow that objects can pass through without even getting detected.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Lotte came up with an idea to use flex sensor on a paper that is attached to back of the hole. 
                        When a ball through it bends the paper which bend the flex sensor that will send a signal that we can measure.
                        We never used the flex sensor before. I borrow one from my friend that was also working with flex sensors. 
                        looked up for the start up code for the flex sensors and test the flex sensor. 
                        Now we know that the flex sensor is working.

                            I removed the old concept of tunnels and replace with it the flex sensor.
                            Me and Ond≈ôej test the sensor on our prototype wall.
                            I had to move to the sensor up and down on back of the hole to get the right values from the sensor.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            I didn't code the game but me and Ond≈ôej who basically code the whole game exchanges ideas of what the best to approach the game. 
                            I also created a Hole class that contains data like x and y of the hole and a function to show the face on the hole.
                            Ond≈ôej wasn't aware of classes and objects in Java. So I explained to him how classes and object works.
                            I also did a lot of testing as in throwing balls into the hole when needed for code testing. We need finally got a score counting system.

                            The rest of the team went out and bought a huge wood panel for our wall. They came back and measure it and cut holes into it. The also painted it.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            The wall that we made was pretty big and heavy. We decided to put our wall on the table to elevate our wall.
                            We brainstormed how to stabilize our wall and made sure that it will stay up during the exposition. 
                            We draw some possible setup for our game which was with triangles or by hanging it with straps.
                            I came up with triangles that you can attach on the wall that will make it stand but we were afraid that it was going to fall to the front since there is no support in the front. 
                            For that I also came with an idea to use clamps to clamp the triangle that are attached on the wall to the table or to make the clamps if we have enough planks.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            We used the rest of the wood from our wall to make triangles and bought wooden planks to attach it to the triangles. 
                            We needed the planks to support the triangles that going to support the wall. 
                            The triangles on itself wasn't enough and not thick enough to screw it on the our wall.
